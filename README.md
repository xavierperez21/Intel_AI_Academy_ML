# Intel AI Academy Machine Learning :tw-1f4bb:
This repository is to save my notes and homeworks from the course of [Intel Machine Learning](https://software.intel.com/en-us/ai/courses/machine-learning).

## Inside this course we learn so much about:
* Reviewing the types of problems that can be solved
* Understanding building blocks
* Learning the fundamentals of building models in machine learning
* Exploring key algorithms

##By the end of this course, students will have practical knowledge of:
   * Supervised learning algorithms
   * Key concepts like under- and over-fitting, regularization, and cross-validation
   * How to identify the type of problem to be solved, choose the right algorithm, tune parameters, and validate a model


There will be one carpet per week, so inside of each carpet is going to be a jupyter notebook file.
Those files will contain homework exercises,  some of those exercises will be already answered and others i will solve it.

So lets learn Machine Learning!
